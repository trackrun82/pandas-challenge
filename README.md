# pandas-challenge

The City School datasets were used to form multiple tables:
  * District Summary
  * School Summary
  * Scores by Grade
  * Scores by School Spending
  * Scores by School Size
  * Scores by School Type

# Conclusions

  * The average math and reading grades were similar across all grades
  * The larger the spending range (per student), the worse the % passing was for math, reading and both.
  * Smaller schools (<2000 students) performed better overall compared to Large schools.
  * Charter schools have significantly more students passing math, reading and both compared to District schools though their average scores are not much different; In fact, the top 5 overall performing schools were all Charter schools contrasted with the bottom 5 overall schools being all District schools.
  * In general, the passing % for reading was higher than for math across all categories for the majority of schools
